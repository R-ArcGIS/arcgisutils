* 'arcgisbinding' is a suggested package without a standard CRAN repository. Per suggestion, I reference and link to documentation on how to install it in the `Description` field. 
* Note that ArcGIS is not the name of a software but is a brand name and is therefore not quoted. Whereas, ArcGIS Pro is software name and is quoted. 
* `detect_errors()` and `auth_*()` function examples are now wrapped in `\dontrun{}` as they will not be able to succeed 
* This is a new release.
